        <h2>My favorite movie</h2>
        <img src="images/Shawshank.jpg" class="style-image">
        <P>Directed by Frank Darabont, "The Shawshank Redemption" is a compelling narrative of hope, friendship, and the
            indomitable human spirit set within the walls of a grim prison. The film follows Andy Dufresne, portrayed by
            Tim Robbins, a man wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of his wife. Despite the crushing reality of life in
            Shawshank, Andy maintains his dignity and hope, gradually influencing those around him, particularly his
            friend Red, played by Morgan Freeman. The movie delves into themes of freedom, resilience, and the power of
            hope, ultimately showcasing the triumph of the human spirit against immense adversity. Its emotional depth
            and inspiring message have cemented "The Shawshank Redemption" as a timeless cinematic masterpiece.</P>
